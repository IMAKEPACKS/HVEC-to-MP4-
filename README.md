# HVEC-to-MP4-
This is a Python project. I made it because apparently the extension for the video codec costs money, and also all the converters on the web are very slow. This is fast, and you can select quality.
# HOW TO RUN
If you are running pure python code file you will need to put the ffmpeg exe's in the same file directory.
